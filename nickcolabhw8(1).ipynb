In this problem we will read the reviews file again, but this time we will do two common pre-processing steps:\n",

The *document frequency* of a word type is the number of documents in the collection that contain at least one instance of the word. If the collection contains $D$ documents and $df_w$ is the document frequency of word $w$, the inverse document frequency for $w$ is usually defined as $-\\log(\\frac{df_w}{D}) = \\log(\\frac{D}{df_w})$.\n",

Instead of recording the term frequency of word $w$ in document $d$, our array will now record the term frequency for $w$ in $d$ *multiplied* by the IDF for $w$. This weighting emphasizes rare words relative to frequent words.\n",

            "[\"You won't be disappointed. We've eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love. Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy. Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. Another note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine. It's definitely Thai...but upgraded. In my opinion, it's perfect. It's also a good place to take someone on his or her first taste of Thai.\"\n",
            " 'Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, \"it\\'s good...for the area,\" but this place is just plain good. I\\'m a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places. That being said, I\\'m definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger. My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I\\'ve never been so happy I couldn\\'t get a table somewhere. We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It\\'s open yet cozy and comfortably cool. For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I\\'ve never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It\\'s a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the \"true Thai foodie.\" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I\\'d caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could\\'ve taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. I\\'ll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!'\n",

The quality has been consistenly very good, from the food to the service. The place is owned and run by a thai family and the food is as close to Thailand as I'll ever get. I've tried other thai places in AZ and in a couple of states and none can compare to Krua thai. As a regular to this place, I recommend giving it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.\"\n",
            " 'OMG amazing!!! This is the go to place for my weekly cheat meal! The egg rolls and chicken pad thai with extra veggies is my favorite meal ever!!

Much like pizza, Thai (or almost any Asian cuisine) is something I could eat almost everyday and being a vegetarian Thai food has a lot of options for me. Why am I telling you this? Cause eating a lot of Thai food makes me picky. Whenever I try any new Thai place I stick with one of two standards: Pad Thai or Green Curry. If you are a Thai restaurant and cannot handle either of these dishes, then you should just close down shop now. As for Thai Rama, they do both very well. I\\'ll even go as far as to say Thai Rama is my favorite Thai food in the valley. It\\'s near my home, open late and the staff is really friendly. I\\'ve eaten here for years and my favorite is the Pad Thai with fried tofu....dare I say the best in the valley?? I prefer my Pad Thai a little on the sweet side, not fishy tasting with some flavor, and most Thai places here have the more \"traditional\" type. If you like it spicy, this place can comply so watch out! Their green veggie curry is flavorful, with a good assortment of veggies. My only complaints would be their hot and sour soup, which is ok but WAY too much ginger flavor...to the point that I couldn\\'t enjoy it. Also, like so many other Thai places, they tempt you with the mango sticky rice only to never have mango!!! When they do, its awesome, otherwise settle for the custard sticky rice which is almost as good.'\n",
            " \"Great Thai food. Great selection. Prices are too low. I normally take home leftovers for a lunch the next day, so cost-wise it's like eating at McDonalds, but taste-wise it's fantastic. You are probably in disbelief but try this place once. Note - I just drink water so if you get a beer that will change your cost equation\"\n",

I loved their pad thai so much and frequented the place to the point where the owner John knew my name and order. Unfortunately it closed down and just kept their second location open. I now drive 35 minutes to dine here. I wish they would once more open a location in Tempe or Scottsdale. It's so authentic delicious and satisfying I crave it all the time. Highly recommend. However the Scottsdale location was much cleaner than this one. Still trying to find something local and comparable. Thai house is good but just not as good. Love Touch of Thai.\"\n",

I love to support independent, non-chain restaurants and when Sala Thai opened up in my neighborhood, I was very excited. I\\'ve eaten there over 10 times so far. It\\'s a great place to introduce Thai food \"newbies\" because the food is great and the menu has lots of photos of the entrees. No complaints about the food. And reasonably priced too. Appetizers worth sampling: spring rolls, chicken satay, and tofu Entrees worth trying: pad thai, pad see-u, curry dishes I saw a complaint here about the time it took to receive their food. The restaurant features a glass wall looking into the kitchen. They make all of their entrees to order; that\\'s why it takes longer. I will gladly wait another 10 minutes knowing I\\'m getting freshly prepared food. One final note: the restaurant is getting popular so watch out for a full restaurant during on-peak hours. Dinner service starts at 5pm and I\\'ve seen it fill up by 5:30pm on weekends.'\n",

We ordered the fried tofu (which is hard to screw up); Red curry with tofu and the pad thai with tofu (since we are both vegan). The Pad Thai was too sweet and had eggs in it when we specifically said we were vegan. The red curry was just ok. It feels like they took the \"A\" team to Red Thai.

It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example). It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car. Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special? Yes, but it was so worth it!

I come back, usually by the end of the day, and he is done. Fair price without a worry. Have been taking my wifes 1997 Chrysler there for years. Have had new transmission, new sets of tires, and multiple other basic maintenance. A vehicle that probably would not have lasted more than 100k miles is still running well at 150k plus miles. Terry has even been kind enough to work with me on payments when I had transmission installed. Can't promise he will do the same with you, but then, I have been going to him for 8 years.

Soooo... the Husband (much more knowledgeable about car stuff) gave Precision Imports a call. They told him to bring the car in to them and they'd make sure it was less. No kidding!!

Honest, straight forward, no-nonsense, I'm running out of adjectives. They told me what I needed, how much it cost and when it would be ready. I picked up my car when they said and that was that. Sometimes they gave extra analysis. Time passed and I moved away for 6 years. I went back to them about a year ago with a mini cooper - they remembered me and wondered why I wasn't driving a Honda or Toyota :-). They honestly told me that they could not fix the issue I had (they did not have the high-tech Mini/BMW equipment required), so Mini fixed it for $1,700. I went back with a Toyota Rav4 - their specialty. Easy in and out for scheduled maintenance and always less than $40. Today, they did maintenance. Friendly service, easy for me in and out. Frank told me that the Right Rear shock was leaking and since it was under warranty I should take it to Toyota. I did, they fixed it free of charge (I know, few things in life are REALLY free - especially at the Toyota Dealership). My point is that Frank told me the up-front truth about my car and didn't try to sell me anything. He could have ignored it but that's not how he/they operate. Which is why he and Al are so well regarded and so appreciated on sites like this. It's also why you don't see their name on billboards, or bus benches, or mailers in your mailbox. No need. Their reputation supplies them with all the business they can handle. And they handle a LOT of business.\"\n",

First off, the oil leak was \"repaired\" only to find out later that it really wasn\\'t. Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail. So, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back. I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \"service engine\" light came on, then went off. A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start. Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead. Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \"service engine\" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn\\'t start. My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since. Now, I\\'m not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well. But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn\\'t notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy. On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.

The last time I left tracks in this garage was after I was up-sold a ton of work that my SUV did not need at the time, to the tune of some nearly $2,000 - when I had gone in for a regular oil change. The car repair sales associate, Damion, seemed surprised when I requested the replaced parts after they finished all the work he \"recommended\" (scare tactic is more accurate). One freshly replaced part \"...couldn\\'t be found.\" (Interesting, in light of the fact that they had just finished it.) The rest of the parts didn\\'t seem to show enough wear to warrant replacement, in my opinion. So, I took them around for a couple of other neutral opinions. Even un-prefaced by explanation, those opinions all concurred with mine. I challenged the need for the work performed with Damion, at Camelback Toyota.

I took my car in as it was time for an oil change and I was convinced my serpentine belt was about to go. It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous. Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell. Virginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine. It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed. It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example). It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car. Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special? Yes, but it was so worth it! Now my little one won't be getting an oil change for another year most likely, but my service advisor, Robert, asked me to please stop by every three months so they could check out my belts, tire pressure, etc just to be safe. Now THAT is service!\"\n",

I went back with a Toyota Rav4 - their specialty. Easy in and out for scheduled maintenance and always less than $40. Today, they did maintenance. Friendly service, easy for me in and out. Frank told me that the Right Rear shock was leaking and since it was under warranty I should take it to Toyota. I did, they fixed it free of charge (I know, few things in life are REALLY free - especially at the Toyota Dealership). My point is that Frank told me the up-front truth about my car and didn't try to sell me anything. He could have ignored it but that's not how he/they operate. Which is why he and Al are so well regarded and so appreciated on sites like this. It's also why you don't see their name on billboards, or bus benches, or mailers in your mailbox. No need.

First off, the oil leak was \"repaired\" only to find out later that it really wasn\\'t. Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail. So, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back. I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \"service engine\" light came on, then went off. A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start. Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead. Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \"service engine\" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn\\'t start. My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since. Now, I\\'m not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well. But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn\\'t notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy. On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.

She returned to Flagstaff and took it immediately to the Toyota dealership in Flag and was told that there wasn't anything wrong with the car. Then last month, I took my 07 prius in for a tune up and was told that there was some 600.00 dollars worth of repair that needed doing. Mainly with oil systems. Having learned from my wife, I delcined the work and took it to Flagstaff and found that one of the jobs was not necessary and the other job should have been included with the tuneup that Camelback T was supposed to do. They charged over $200. for the simple tuneup and then didn't do all the work. When you look at the facility, you'll see it's modern and expensive looking. Perhaps from bilking unsuspecting customers with sleasy practices. Toyota on Camelback won't see me again. Won't see you again unless you can't learn from other peoples experiences. I don't know which dealership does fair and honest work but I intend to find out; Selling cars might be ok but repair is a gyp.\"\n",
            " 'Careful! Shady guys working there. I broke down on the 101 and was about 15 miles from home, did a quick search on the net and had my tow truck driver take my car to this place. They called a day or so later and gave me a quote of well over 1000 to fix my car and started naming a whole laundry list of \"what ifs\" that can be wrong and how much it will cost me if the \"what ifs\" happen. Well needless to say, I had my car towed out of there immediately. Took it to my usual mechanic and even after paying the tow truck, and Greulichs assanine \"diagnostic\" fee, I was still less than the Greulichs butthole quote. Oh yeah, and NONE of the \"what ifs\" I was given were an issue. BTW, What the hell do shocks have to do with \"get my car up on the road and running\"???? Just sayin\\'. I may be a girl, however you cant pull a fast one on me.... OH yeah, I am placing a complaint with the BBB.'\n",
            " \"The service was rude and when I left my car there for nearly two hours they still couldn't manage to get the oil change done by the time they said they would.\"\n",
            " 'Wow, there are quite a few five star reviews. I try not to call into question the legitimacy of other reviewers but my experience was very different from these five star reviewers. I had an experience similar to the reviewer from Fremont, CA. I brought in the bait and switch $15.88 oil change, fluid check and tire rotation coupon downloaded directly from their website. They told me that my car (\\'09 3.8 genesis) required a special oil filter. This is a falsehood. When I called in to set an appointment, the person on the phone told me that the coupon would not work because my car required full synthetic oil. I told him that he was incorrect and that the owner\\'s manual only suggested synthetic blend. When I realized that they were trying to charge me for a full priced oil change, I asked the person over the phone if the coupon would work and he said, \"yes.\" It was only when I drove down there, that they used the filter excuse to invalidate the coupon and charge me just under $29. Additionally, I did not receive the tire rotation. This is pretty much the definition of Bait and Switch.']\n"
